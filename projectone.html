          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <div class="section">
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p class="bold">1. Young adults that are freshly off of their parents health insurance are often frustrated and discouraged when looking for new providers.</p>
          <p class="bold">2. Insurance is complicated.</p>
          <p class="bold">3. Finding a doctor in the area can be confusing.</p>
          <p class="bold">4. Going to the doctor can be expensive.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <h2>Insights</h2>
            <p>Most of our respondents said that they most often use Google to find a healthcare provider in their area. However, it’s often overwhelming because of the copious amounts of providers. Respondents also found healthcare in the United States to be too complicated and expensive. This has resulted in individuals avoiding the doctors office unless absolutely necessary.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <p class="bold">1. Create an application that simplifies the healthcare process.</p>
            <p class="bold">2. Rank doctors and providers based off of real patient reviews.</p>
            <p class="bold">3. Include copay amounts for insurance companies.</p>
            <p class="bold">4. Be able to create appointments with doctors that are nearby.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="screens">

        <section class="overview">
          <h1>Process</h1>
          <div class="section">
          <h2>Assumptions</h2>
          <p class="top">I made some general assumptions about people and finding healthcare providers.</p>
          <p class="bold">1. People find it difficult to find a healthcare provider;</p>
          <p class="bold">2. They don’t want to spend a lot of time and energy finding a healthcare provider;</p>
          <p class="bold">3. Finding nearby doctors that are credible is difficult;</p>
          <p class="bold bottom">4. People are often taken off guard by the price of healthcare services.</p>
          <p>In a post-pandemic world, people are leaving their homes less and less, especially to go see the doctor.  Finding the right doctor nearby is often very complex and overwhelming for individuals.</p>

          <div class="section">
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>To better understand the users needs regarding healthcare, my team and I conducted several user interviews.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row rowprocess">

            <p class="bold interviews">Key takeaways from our user interviews:</p>
            <p class="bold">1. As users stated they want a simplified way to look at insurance and healthcare providers, Healthcare Genie should categorize and rank providers for users.</p>
            <p class="bold">2. Because doctor trips can be expensive, users want to know what their visit will cost upfront along with any additional fees, Healthcare Genie should show copays and other fees that you’ll be charged before your visit.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <h2>Persona</h2>
            <p>My teams user interviews gained us very valuable user insights which we then used to form a user persona. The main goal of the persona is to display those patterns and pain points, which then allowed us to further empathize with users.</p>

          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Considering Shaundra’s goals and pain points, the main theme is to simplify the process of finding a healthcare provider for users while taking into account those providers’ proximity to the user.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <h2>User Journey Map</h2>
            <p>By creating a user journey map I gained a better understanding of the users’ expectations and their experiences while finding a provider without our app.</p>

            <h2>Competitive Analysis Highlights</h2>
            <p>To create a unique value proposition for Healthcare Genie, I analyzed our top current competitors. Healthcare Genie offers the main features that our competitors provide to users while our app is more organized and doesn’t require any extra fees to use.</p>
